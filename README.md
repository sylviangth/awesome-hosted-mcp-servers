# Awesome Hosted Cloud MCP Servers

![alt text](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)

A curated list of Hosted & Managed Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers accessible via a simple URL endpoint.

## Why This Repository

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is transforming how AI applications connect to the tools and data needed for real-world tasks. It acts as a universal plug, allowing AI agents, chatbots, and other applications to seamlessly interact with diverse external capabilities.

While MCP servers can be run locally by developers, a powerful and rapidly growing approach involves Hosted Cloud MCP Servers. These are pre-built, managed services, often provided by companies like Zapier, Make, Composio, or specific SaaS platforms, that expose MCP capabilities through a network endpoint (typically using HTTP/SSE or Streamable HTTP).

### Why focus on Hosted Cloud MCP Servers?

- **Zero Local Setup**: Connect your AI applications instantly! Simply provide the server's URL (and any necessary credentials) ‚Äì no need to download code, manage dependencies, or run processes on your own machine.
- **Ultimate Accessibility**: Empowers everyone, including non-technical business users, to leverage advanced AI automation by easily connecting tools they already use (like CRMs, marketing platforms, project managers) to their AI agents.
- **Effortless Integration**: Quickly add powerful functionalities ‚Äì from sending emails and updating spreadsheets to interacting with complex SaaS APIs ‚Äì by plugging into these ready-to-use endpoints.
- **Scalability & Reliability**: Benefit from services managed by providers, handling the underlying infrastructure, uptime, and maintenance for you.
- **Seamless Sharing**: Build and share AI agents or workflows connected to these hosted servers with teammates or clients, knowing they can use them immediately without individual technical hurdles.

This Awesome List is dedicated to discovering and showcasing these plug-and-play, hosted MCP server endpoints. Explore the list to find services that can instantly enhance your AI applications, or contribute details about other hosted MCP offerings available to the community!
