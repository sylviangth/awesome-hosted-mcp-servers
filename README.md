# Awesome Hosted Cloud MCP Servers ![alt text](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)

A curated list of Hosted & Managed Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers accessible via a simple URL endpoint.

## Why Hosted Cloud MCP Servers

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) lets AI applications connect to external tools and data for real-world tasks. While developers can run MCP servers locally, hosted cloud options offer significant advantages:

- **Zero setup**: Connect instantly with just a URL and credentials
- **Accessibility**: Enables non-technical users to leverage AI automation with familiar tools
- **Easy integration**: Quickly add powerful functions to AI applications
- **Managed infrastructure**: Benefit from provider-maintained reliability and scalability
- **Seamless sharing**: Distribute AI agents to teammates without individual technical hurdles

This repository showcases these plug-and-play MCP endpoints that can instantly enhance your AI applications. For self-hosted options, see [awesome-mcp-servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers).
